# herdr event hook: flash the pane, play the alert, draw the sprite that goes
# with it.
#
# herdr's own [ui.sound] plays one mp3 and draws nothing. This pairs each sound
# with a flash on the pane that wants attention, and a sprite on the one event
# that needs a human.
#
# It cannot call those functions directly. Both flash through `flash-term`,
# which locates the GUI terminal by walking process ancestry; a hook is spawned
# by the herdr server, whose ancestry is the server, so the flash would land
# somewhere else or nowhere. Under herdr the right target is narrower anyway:
# write the colour to that one pane's pty, the way herdr-colorize does, and one
# pane out of nine lights up rather than the whole window.
#
# The clip is not hardcoded. sounds/packs.json names a set of alerts — a game,
# which clip inside it, and the sprite that belongs with that clip — and
# scripts/gen-alert-tables.py turns that into the case table sourced below, so
# the pairing is written once in the file that also says where the media comes
# from. Nothing here parses JSON: this runs once per status change on every
# pane, and it already pays two `jq` execs to read the event.
#
# Every step of the picker degrades on its own. No table, no synced pack, or a
# clip that is not in it, and the bundled pair plays with no sprite — an alert
# that fires plainly beats one that does not fire.
